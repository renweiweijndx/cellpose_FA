# cellpose_FA
This is a segmentation tool based on cellpose to segment flourescent focal adhesion images
This model was retrained based on cellpose cyto3 model. Immunestained Vinculin was chosen as the marker for focal adhesion. The training data was aquired with a Zeiss lsm710 laser scan confocal microscope with 60 × oil immersive objective (N.A = 1.4). 8 bit gray scale images (1024 × 1024 pixel) was split into 256 × 256 pixel patches for traning.
